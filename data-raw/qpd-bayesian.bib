  abstract = {Quantile functions are equivalent alternatives to distribution functions in modeling and analysis of statistical data. The present article discusses the role of quantile functions in reliability studies. We present the hazard, mean residual, variance residual, and percentile residual quantile functions, their mutual relationships and expressions for the quantile functions in terms of these functions. Further, some theoretical results relating to the Hankin and Lee (2006) lambda distribution are discussed.},

  abstract = {The role of quantile functions in modeling various forms of statistical data is well established. Generally classical procedures like method of moments, L-moments, percentiles etc are employed in estimating the parameters of the model. In the present work an attempt is made to infer parameters in the Bayesian framework with special emphasis to distributions in which the quantile functions do not posses tractable distribution functions. The procedure is illustrated for some distributions and real life data.},
