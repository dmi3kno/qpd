  abstract = {In decision analysis, analysts must often encode an expert's uncertainty of a quantity (e.g., the volume of oil reserves in a proven, but undeveloped oil field) using a probability distribution. This is commonly done by eliciting a triplet of low-base-high percentile assessments, such as the \{10th, 50th, 90th\} percentiles, from the expert, and then fitting a probability distribution from a well-known family (e.g., lognormal) to the assessed quantile-probability (or QP) pairs. However, curve fitting often requires non-linear, non-convex optimization over a distribution parameter space, and the fitted distribution often never honors the assessed QP pairs \textendash{} reducing both the fidelity of the model, and trust in the analysis. The development of quantile-parameterized distributions (or QPDs), distributions that are parameterized by, and thus precisely honor the assessed QP pairs, is a very important yet nascent topic in decision analysis, and contributions in the literature are sparse. This dissertation extends existing work on QPDs by strategically developing a new smooth probability distribution system (known as J-QPD) that is parameterized by (and honors) assessed QP pairs. J-QPD also honors various natural support regimes \textendash{} for example: bounded (e.g., fractional uncertainties, such as market shares, are necessarily bounded between zero and one); semi-bounded (e.g., volume of oil reserves is necessarily non-negative, but may have no well-defined upper bound); etc. We then show that J-QPD is maximally-feasible, highly flexible, and approximates the shapes of a vast array of commonly-named distributions (e.g., normal, lognormal, beta, etc.) with potent accuracy, using a single system. This work also presents efficient, high-fidelity methods for capturing dependence between two or more uncertainties by combining J-QPD with modern correlation assessment and modeling techniques. We then provide an application of J-QPD to a famous decision analysis example, demonstrating how J-QPD facilitates rapid Monte Carlo simulation, and how its implementation can aid actual decisions that might otherwise be made wrongly if commonly-used discrete methods are used. We conclude by noting important tradeoffs between J-QPD and existing QPD systems, and offer several extensions for future research, including a first look at designing new discrete distributions using J-QPD.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new class of continuous probability distributions that are flexible enough to represent a wide range of uncertainties such as those that commonly arise in business, technology, and science. In many such cases, the nature of the uncertainty is more naturally characterized by quantiles than by parameters of familiar continuous probability distributions. In the practice of decision analysis, it is common to fit a hand-drawn curve to quantile outputs from probability elicitations on a continuous uncertain quantity and to then discretize the curve. The resulting discrete probability distribution is an approximation that cuts off the distribution's tails and eliminates intermediate values. Quantile-parameterized distributions address this problem by using quantiles themselves to parameterize a continuous probability distribution. We define quantile-parameterized distributions, illustrate their flexibility and range of applicability, and conclude with practical considerations when parameterizing distributions using inconsistent quantile assessments.},

  abstract = {The metalog distributions constitute a new system of continuous univariate probability distributions designed for flexibility, simplicity, and ease/speed of use in practice. The system is comprised of unbounded, semibounded, and bounded distributions, each of which offers nearly unlimited shape flexibility compared to previous systems of distributions. Explicit shape-flexibility comparisons are provided. Unlike other distributions that require nonlinear optimization for parameter estimation, the metalog quantile functions and probability density functions have simple closed-form expressions that are quantile parameterized linearly by cumulative-distribution-function data. Applications in fish biology and hydrology show how metalogs may aid data and distribution research by imposing fewer shape constraints than other commonly used distributions. Applications in decision analysis show how the metalog system can be specified with three assessed quantiles, how it facilities Monte Carlo simulation, and how applying it aided an actual decision that would have been made wrongly based on commonly used discrete methods.This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

Our broad range of topics of univariate and bivariate probability and statistics are best summarized by the key words. Two fascinating practical examples are given that involve positive mean and negative median investment returns, and the relationship between radon concentration and cancer.},

Quantile-parameterized distributions are characterized by high shape flexibility and interpretability of its parameters, and are therefore useful for elicitation on observables. To encode uncertainty in the quantiles elicited from experts, we propose a Bayesian model based on the metalog distribution and a version of the Dirichlet prior. The resulting ``hybrid'' expert elicitation protocol for characterizing uncertainty in parameters using questions about the observable quantities is discussed and contrasted to parametric and predictive elicitation.},

We describe the method of *indirect likelihood* to be used in the Bayesian models with sampling distributions which lack an explicit cumulative distribution function. We provide examples and demonstrate the equivalence of the "quantile-based" (indirect) likelihood to the conventional "density-defined" (direct) likelihood. We consider practical aspects of the numerical inversion of quantile function by root-finding required by the indirect likelihood method. In particular, we consider a problem of ensuring the validity of an arbitrary quantile function with the help of Chebyshev polynomials and provide useful tips and implementation of these algorithms in Stan and R. We also extend the same method to propose the definition of an *indirect prior* and discuss the situations where it can be useful},
